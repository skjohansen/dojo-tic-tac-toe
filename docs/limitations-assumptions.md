# Limitations and assumptions

In order to minize the scope of the application is the following limitations and assumptions made for the first version.

The list has no ordering.

* The gameboard is always 3x3
* There is always two players, no more, no less
* Both players are dumb bots
* The output of the application is through commandline
* The application is started and run via commandline
* There is no user interaction
    * Start the game from commandline
    * See the result in commandline
* There is only bot players, no human players

## Future thought which can break the limitations

The list has no ordering.

* Wrap the game within an API, make output to api results
* Human players
* Save results in database
* User interface in website
